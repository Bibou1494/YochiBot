## What's this bot ?

I made this bot for my friend's server, It's a bot that:
- Ban badwords
- Allows users to send embeds

## Building

To build you first need Node.JS.

First clone the repository and then enter the following command

```bash
npm install
```

Then you will need to make a file named ```.env```, in that file you will enter the following

```env
TOKEN=
CLIENTID=
```

And after that to run the bot do

```bash
npm start
```
